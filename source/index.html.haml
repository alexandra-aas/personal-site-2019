    Hi, I’m Ali Aas (pronounced 'oz' like the wizard). I’m a designer at
    #{link_to 'Upstatement', 'https://www.upstatement.com/studio/', target: '_blank'},
    a design studio located everywhere.
  %p
    Some of my work at Upstatement includes...
    bringing the serene experience of visiting the
    #{link_to 'Arnold Arboretum', 'https://www.upstatement.com/work/emergence/', target: '_blank'}
    to the web (2020),
    introducing investors and the public to the
    #{link_to 'energy company', 'https://cfs.energy/', target: '_blank'}
    that will finally make fusion a reality (2019),
    crafting quirky yet direct informational pages for
    #{link_to 'MIT', 'http://web.mit.edu/research/', target: '_blank'} (2018),
    and making venture capital friendly again through the redesign of
    #{link_to 'Emergence Capital', 'https://www.emcap.com/', target: '_blank'} (2018).
  %p
    Before Upstatement, I worked as a Product Designer helping primarily startups build web and mobile apps.
  %p
    Outside of work, I used to do more things. But these days, I'm trying to shake my imposter syndrome
    by finally making breads that require yeast and by challenging myself to run a full marathon. I also
    got promoted to a new role: Mom.
